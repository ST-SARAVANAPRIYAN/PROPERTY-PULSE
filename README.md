## Problem Statement

In real estate, investors and analysts often struggle to track property market trends across different regions. Although large volumes of property transaction data are available, they are scattered and difficult to analyze without technical tools or expertise. This makes it challenging to make timely and informed investment decisions.

Property Pulse addresses this need by offering:
- Visual market trend analysis across different regions
- Transaction value, land price, and property usage analysis
- Growth tracking and rental yield opportunity visualization
- Data-driven investment decision support
